# 2D Up Down Adventure Game

Step into a dynamic 2D adventure where tactical movement and strategic awareness are key! Navigate a world where different entities have unique bounding boxes that influence visibility and mobility:

### Black: Blocks both vision and movement
### Red: Blocks vision but allows movement
### Blue: Blocks movement but allows vision
### White: Blocks neither vision nor movement

Engage with enemies that patrol their surroundings and chase the player upon detection, adding a layer of challenge to every encounter. Switch between two toggleable camera viewsâ€”player-follow view for immersive gameplay and grid view for strategic planning. With health bars, AI-driven enemies, and an interactive environment, this adventure will keep you on your toes!
